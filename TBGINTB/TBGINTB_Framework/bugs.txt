- Work item tracking software
	- I need this
- Delete items from UI
	- Shouldn't be too hard ...
- RoomState [Time] should not be nullable
	- It just causes too much heartache
- Location [Name] should be in a separate [dev] table
	- This information is only needed for development purposes
- RoomState and ParagraphState should start at 1, not 0
	- Do I really need this?
- Items should all be in one table, with an ItemType (e.g. Item, Event, Character)
	- Don't call them items; call them Objects
- Paragraphs should be called Spans
	- Minor, but more accurate
